## Counting with Apache Spark and Algebird
Many Big-Data computations involve counting different types of data. The open-source Algebird library from Twitter enables easily structuring computations as "counting" problems that can be parallelized and executed on map-reduce frameworks like Spark. The talk will briefly cover the properties of abstract algebraic types like semigroups, monoids and rings and how to leverage their properties using Algebird and Spark in counting problems. The talk will demonstrate the use of these abstract algebraic types in implementations of standard Big Data probabilistic counting algorithms like Count-Min-Sketch (top-K items) and Hyper-Log-Log (unique items) in Algebird and Spark.
